# Sales_Prediction
This project focuses on forecasting product sales using machine learning by analyzing historical sales data and various influencing factors, such as advertising spend, promotions, and customer segmentation. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, detect and remove outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, and apply feature scaling for better model performance. The machine learning model, built using the XGBoost regressor, is trained to predict sales based on these factors. The performance of the model is evaluated using key metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² Score to assess its accuracy. The final goal of this project is to provide businesses with a predictive tool that can help optimize marketing strategies, adjust advertising budgets, and improve promotional efforts to drive sales growth effectively.
